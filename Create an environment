# Create a new environment in Python

This is needed when Python is acting funny (there are probably more scientific reasons that I still have not figured out)

Here I re-create an environment for pandas

## Steps
* Open anaconda command prompt
* type `conda create --name ENVIRONMENT python=3.10 pandas
* Follow the instructions

## Add packages to the environment
* pyarrow: Needed to save and use parquet files
      `conda install -c conda -forge pyarrow`
* Jupyter: Needed to re-launch Jupyter notebook in the new environment
      `conda install -c conda -forge jupyter`
